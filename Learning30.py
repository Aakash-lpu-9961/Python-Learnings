# Definition of Decorators
"""
    [1]. Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to 
            modify the behaviour of function or class.
    
    [2]. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the 
            wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. 
"""

# What is first class function in Python
"""
    First class objects in a language are handled uniformly throughout. 
    They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures. 
    A programming language is said to support first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class objects. 
    Python supports the concept of First Class functions.
"""

# Properties of First Class FUnctions
"""
    [1]. A function is an instance of the Object type.
    [2]. We can store the function in a variable.
    [3]. We can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
    [4]. We can return the function from a function.
    [5]. We can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦

# Functions are objects :

#  Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions:

# Functions can return another function:
"""
 Because functions are objects we can return a function from another function. In the below example, 
 the create_adder function returns adder function.
